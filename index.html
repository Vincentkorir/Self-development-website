            <h2>About the Author</h2>

            <p>Vincent K. Korir is a lifelong learner, educator, and healthcare professional whose journey has taken him across continents and disciplines. Born in Kenya, Vincent began his career as a high school teacher and administrator, dedicating over seven years to empowering young minds through education. His passion for leadership and service later led him to Australia, where he pursued project management at Edith Cowan University before relocating to the United States.

Now based in Minnesota, Vincent is completing his Bachelor of Science in Nursing at Rasmussen University and works as a dedicated mental health technician. With over five years of experience in direct patient care and over a decade of leadership in both community and corporate sectors, Vincent brings a unique blend of compassion, resilience, and global perspective to everything he does.

Climbing Your Mountain: 12 Rules for a Life of Genius and Growth was born from Vincent’s own experiences of reinvention, growth, and the challenges of starting over. Inspired by the wisdom of thinkers like Naval Ravikant, Steve Jobs, and ancient philosophers, Vincent wrote this book as a roadmap for anyone striving to live with intention, break free from limitations, and reach their fullest potential.

Vincent believes that we are all climbing our own mountains—and that with the right mindset, tools, and faith, we can rise higher than we ever imagined.</p>
